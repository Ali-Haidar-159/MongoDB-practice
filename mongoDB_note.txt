# Introductions :


*** MongoDB is a document database. It stores data in a JSON format type called BSON.

*** A record in MongoDB is a document, which basically consists of key-value pairs. This structure is similar to the structure of JSON objects.

*** MongoDB is a document database and can be installed locally or hosted in the cloud.

*** SQL databases are considered relational databases. They store related data in separate tables. When data is needed, the data is joined together by querying multiple tables.

MongoDB, on the other hand, is a document database, often referred to as a non-relational database. This does not mean that relational data cannot be stored in a document database; Rather it implies that relational data is stored differently. It can be better called a non-tabular database.

MongoDB stores data in flexible documents. Instead of multiple tables, you can keep all your related data together. It reads data very fast.

Also, MongoDB can have multiple data groups. In MongoDB, these are called collections instead of tables.
